		<p>I have made a conscious effort to keep my design elements separate from the structure of my webpages, and so far it has been a little challenging. I’m still learning all of the commands for CSS and HTML, and so it has been a challenge to know what goes where. I have caught myself multiple times putting design commands in the HTML markup. Going back and changing it to a CSS command is annoying, and that has helped me not make the same mistakes. I feel comfortable with the progress I’ve made so far with keeping the two elements separate.</p>
	<p>My markup so far contains all of the content for my landing page, but is lacking some CSS elements to make it what I envisioned. I had a lot of trouble figuring out whether to use divs or not, and ultimately decided that it was going to be the easiest way for me to organize everything. After going back through all of my HTML and adding divs, it was much simpler for me to d=command certain sections to display a certain way. I’m still struggling with all of the CSS commands and getting the design the way I want it to ultimately look, but I feel confident that I can figure it out eventually.</p>
	<p>Going forward, I will make more of an effort to think of structure and design separately. I keep catching myself trying to code my HTML markup to add style elements, and I think that if I mentally separate the two entities that will help me keep them separate in my code. Hopefully this will help me make fewer mistakes and result in fewer changes that I will have to make later. I will also have a friend or someone with experience with coding take a look at my markup because another set of eyes might catch some errors or typos that need to be fixed and can point out style elements that should be in my CSS markup.</p>
