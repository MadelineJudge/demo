		<p class="p1">My scrum team came in handy when I had issues resolving HTML errors and design issues. They gave me some great advice and input about what did and did not look good with my header image and design palette, and I got some great feedback on how my webpages looked when I finally got around to coding. I had a lot of trouble trying to get my navigation bar to span the width of my page and how to get my border to surround all of my content. My scrum group was able to help me troubleshoot these issues, and in turn I was able to help them with problems they were having. I helped Maggie with linking her webpages together without them breaking, and also how to set up her content pages to get her header photo the way she wanted it. Working in scrum teams was helpful to a point, but I also just needed to sit by myself and fiddle with code to get everything the way I wanted it.</p>
		<p class="p1">During the workshop sessions, I worked with my scrum team some days. Other days, I worked on my code by myself. There were a lot of parts of my website that I just had to play with to get the way I wanted, and I eventually got it right. My goals for the workshop periods were to get one element right every session, and I was able to achieve that for the most part. There were days when I got too frustrated to continue trying to code, and so I put it away and fixed it later.</p>
		<p class="p1">I found support from friends of mine that have taken WRA 210 before, and I also visited the Creativity Exploratory and found someone to help me there. A friend recommended the W3Schools website, which is an awesome resource that has code tips for pretty much any kind of code I could ever need. It was really helpful with all of the problems I had while building my site. I also found the W3S validator website very helpful, especially because it showed me what was wrong with my code and gave suggestions on how to fix it.</p>
